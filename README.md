# Easy Franchise: Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-kyma-multitenant-extension)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-kyma-multitenant-extension)

> Note: The content of this GitHub repository has been created as source for the SAP Discovery Center Mission [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/). So we recommend using directly the mission in the SAP Discovery Center.

## Description

The application Easy Franchise has been build to help stakeholders to learn how to develop a multitenant application running on the Kyma environment of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) extending SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

Due to the complexity of this topic, our team has taken some compromise compared to a real application. So, this application doesn't aim to be used for productive usage.

The repository has been structured into 2 different sections:
* [documentation](/documentation/README.md): Here you will find details about the architecture, the components, and a step-by-step guide to set up the application EasyFranchise.
* [code](/code/easyfranchise/source/README.md): Here you will find the code of all the components needed to run the application.

## Who Is This Mission For?

The business scenario of this tutorial has been created with the partner as focus persona. The purpose of this project is to help SAP partners to get a quick start on developing a multitenant application and provide best practices.
This is of course not exclusively for SAP partner and can be useful for every person looking for details on how to build a multitenant application running on Kyma. It is suitable for new or experienced developers on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

## Focus Topics of the Mission

The tutorial focuses on the following aspects:
- Multitenancy
- Kyma environment on SAP BTP
- Partner ecosystem
- Extension SaaS (extending an SAP LoB solution), not a standalone SaaS
- Freedom to use non-SAP frameworks and tools without CAP neither SAPUI5 (but indeed SAP Fiori like UI)
