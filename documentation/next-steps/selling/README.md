# Sell Your Solution as an SAP Partner

Solutions developed by SAP partners need to be commercialized using one of the existing commercial models for SAP partners through the Software Partner Progression journey, and monetized via a revenue share:

* Starting as Validated, showcasing the SAP partner application to the world in the SAP Store.
* Spotlight – Receive additional enablement and go-to-market support as your application gains success.
* Certain strategic SAP partner solutions can secure an invitation to the SAP Endorsed Application initiative with premium certifications and high-touch support from our executive sales team. SAP Endorsed Apps are a new category of solutions from SAP’s partner ecosystem to complement and extend SAP’s solution portfolio with cloud products integrating into SAP cloud assets.
* A few selected applications are invited into the SAP solution extensions portfolio, where the application is sold and supported as an SAP solution. SAP solution extensions are essential strategic solutions sold by SAP that are developed by an elite selection of independent software partners. These solutions offer competitive cross-solutions and cross-industry functionalities that complement our joint client’s business solutions.

All solutions are made available through our digital marketplace in SAP App Center, which is the partner's key point of access to 440,000 global customers. Backed by the credibility of SAP, SAP partners can expose their solutions to senior leaders with buying power from across all lines of business – representing leading businesses, from over 25 industries, that are looking to optimize their investment in SAP solutions.
