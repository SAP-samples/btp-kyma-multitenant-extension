    1. Set up your account model.
    2. Configure your environment.

   Within the Feature Set B, account administrators can use [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI)](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) to set up new Cloud Foundry development projects. The cf CLI is the command line tool for convenient account management, such as managing global accounts, directories, subaccounts, entitlements, environment instances multitenant application subscriptions, and users and their authorizations.
