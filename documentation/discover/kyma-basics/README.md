# Discover the Basics of BTP, Kyma Runtime

Before going deeper with this mission, we recommend to know the basics on how to use Kyma in a single tenant application.

The mission ["Getting Started with the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime"](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3252/3281/) gives for example a good overview on how to provision and configure systems in the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.
You may also have a look at the [official documentation](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest) if you want to refresh your knowledge. 
More tutorials can be found in the [documentation](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/03-tutorials/) or in the [SAP Samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples).
