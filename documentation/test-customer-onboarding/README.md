# Test Customer Onboarding

## Prerequisites

You have gone through all the steps described in section [Deploy](../../documentation/deploy/README.md).

## Overview

In our scenario, we assume that the partner is taking over the configuration of the consumer subaccount as this is often the case.
> Note: In your business scenario, you can of course give the customer system admins access to the subaccount so that they can configure the destination, for example. You can then do it by adding the users and giving them the right role collection.

Before starting with the onboarding of the customer, a partner will typically need to request some information. Here is an overview of the data requested from the partner:
* Name and logo of the company
* Name and email address of a mentor coordinator
* Details of mentors

This section is structured as followed:
* Create a Consumer Subaccount
* Configure a Destination
* Subscribe to the Easy Franchise Application
* Manage Users
* Run the Application
* OPTIONAL: Test the Multitenancy
