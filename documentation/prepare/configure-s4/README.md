# Set Up SAP S/4HANA Cloud

You can either use SAP S/4HANA Cloud to run our application or you can use our mock server, if you do not have or do not want to use a real SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. This section describes both options.

## SAP S/4HANA Cloud

To use an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you have to connect our application to this SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. From all the functionality offered by SAP S/4HANA Cloud, we only need access to BusinessPartner OData V2 Rest API.

See [Enable the Business Partner OData V2 Rest API in an S/4HANA Cloud system](/documentation/appendix/enable-odata-of-s4hana/README.md) formore detials.

See [APIs for Business Partner](https://help.sap.com/viewer/44e06f22436c43e582db6ccd5250e29b/2020.000/en-US/9fca825858239244e10000000a4450e5.html) in the SAP S4/HANA documentation for more details.

## Business Partner Mock Server
