# Welcome to the Mission
In this mission you will learn how to develop a multitenant application running on the Kyma environment of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). 
The application called Easy Franchise is an extension of a SAP S/4 HANA Cloud and has been build based using microservices. Due to the complexity of this topic, our team has taken some compromise compared to a real application. So, this application doesn't aim to be used for productive usage. See below the solution diagram of the EasyFranchise application:

You can find the code of the application components in this Github [repository](/code).

## Who Is This Mission For?
